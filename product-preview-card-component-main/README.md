## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [link](https://vanilla-js-projects-gilt.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

#### Learnings of this project includes
 - Build mobile first view and then move on to desktop. 
 - Setting max-width for desktop view helps instead of defining a particular height and width.
 - Using semantic html for better accessibility


### Continued development

- Will continue learning more about making smooth transitions from mobile view to desktop view as the width of the content takes more space than the image.  


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powel's videos on CSS](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This helped me for designing responsive layours. I really liked his teaching style and will use it going forward.
- [Wes bos' grid playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG) - This is an amazing playlist which helped me finally understand grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
